            <p>
                Mom found me crying in my room.
                She asked why i was crying and
                I didn't know what to say.
                I was silent at first just trying
                not to cry anymore. <br> <br>
                I just didn't know what to do.
                She thought it was those guys again.
                It wasn't. <br> <br> It was the fact that I
                may never come close to these
                amazing people. That I will forever
                live in their shadow, all because I
                wasn't a dwarf. <br> <br> All because I was
                some filth blood. I won't be an
                amazing craftsman like my parents.
                Mom didn't know why i was crying
                and just tried to comfort me. <br> <br>
                Dad then came in the room with an
                angry face looking at me and somehow
                like always just knew. I don't know
                how he does it but he always knows. <br> <br>
                I can never hide a thing from him.
                He just looked at me and said
                "Get up and come with me".
                <br> <br>
                Mom tried stopping him saying
                that i need to relax first but
                dad disagreed adding <br> <br>
                "When a craftsman feels inadequate
                he must craft, for only then will
                he understand he is a fool." <br> <br>
                I thought it was weird, but dad
                is always right so I followed him.
                We ended up just making a bunch of
                random little things like some tools
                and hinges and whatnot. <br> <br> Then we went
                to dad's friends and gave it to them.
                Dad looked at them with such eyes
                you'd think they'd turn to stone. <br> <br>
                But I was looking away as I wasn't
                proud of my work. They then thanked
                us but before we left dad asked them
                what they thought of our work. <br> <br>
                They said it was very good and high
                quality as always, which is odd as
                is wasn't. I made them. Even the ones
                dad made, he made sure to not do as
                well. <br> <br> I saw how he made sure that they
                were the same quality as mine.
                So I asked why they lied. They said
                simply that they didn't. They didn't
                look like they were lying. <br> <br> But they
                were wrong. It can't be the same as
                always as they claimed. So why? <br> <br>
                Dad explained saying <br> <br>
                "none craftsman
                don't know shit about our work,
                you can show them some scrap and
                they'd say it was art. We are the
                ones so hard on our selves because
                we know we can do better, so just
                do better." <br> <br>
                So simple. That's all
                it was. As always dad is amazing. <br> <br>
                Dad then asked that i won't tell
                mom that he cursed as he won't hear
                the end of it. I won't, but if mom
                asked I won't be able to lie to her. <br> <br>
                I told him as much and he agreed.
                Saying i don't need to lie just
                not tell. <br> <br> <br> Mom and dad are the best.
