            <h2>
                Soul Acquisition
            </h2>
            <p>
                to acquire a soul is a difficult task. holding on to that which is ethreal is both risky and
                difficult
                to gather and
                maintain. souls hold immense magic power that is both fascinating and highly dangerous. a single
                mistake
                could cause the
                soul to evaporate into a cloud of mana. or a ball of flame and misery...
                <br> <br>
                i am on a path to collect souls to study and maybe learn how to make artificial souls to cure
                the
                beastkins and return
                them to their original races.
                <br> <br>
                there are rumors of a soul stealing dagger called Angkorr in the north. i must find it. i
                contacted
                mistress and she
                agreed to go fetch it. she doesn't own the name Dagger's Frontier for no reason. the solution
                for
                the
                beastkins is at
                hand.
